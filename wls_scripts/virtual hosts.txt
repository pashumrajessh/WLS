A virtual host is a set of host names to which WebLogic
Server instances (servers) or clusters respond. Create
virtual hosts in order to maintain more than one server on
only one machine. Configure virtual hosts to meet your
specifications.

To create a virtual host:

   1. If you have not already done so, in the Change Center
of the Administration Console, click Lock & Edit (see Use
the Change Center).
   2. In the left pane of the console, expand Environments
and select Virtual Hosts to open the Virtual Hosts page.
   3. Click New.
   4. On the Create a New Virtual Host page, enter the name
that will identify your virtual host.

      Note: Once you create a virual host, you cannot rename
it. Instead, you must delete it and create another one that
uses the new name.
   5. Click Ok.
   6. To activate these changes, in the Change Center of the
Administration Console, click Activate Changes.
      Not all changes take effect immediately—some require a
restart

virtual hosting have two types 
.name based VH
  2.ip based VH
In name based VH we use one ip address and different domain 
names like 
192.168.50.103 www.xxx.com
192.168.50.103 www.yyy.com
192.168.50.103 www.zzz.com.......

this can useful redusing the band width of a network&some 
else(recommended in local system)


coming to ip based u can assign one ip address for one 
domain like

192.168.50.103 www.xxx.com
192.168.50.104 www.yyy.com
192.168.50.105 www.zzz.com

coming to weblogic VH done by using ipbased because to 
provide high performence for each application.
